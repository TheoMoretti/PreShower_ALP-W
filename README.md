# PreShower_ALP-W
This repository uses the code written by Felix Kling for the simulations of the ALP-W events generated from Interaction Point at the ATLAS experiment at CERN.

The code was modified in many ways to obtain the following results: 
  * Study the topology of the di-photons events coming from the decay of the ALP. 
  * Compute the number of events for many configurations of mass and couplings for the ALP model considered.
