# PreShower_ALP-W
This repository uses the code written by Felix Kling for the simulations of the ALP events generated from Interaction Point at the ATLAS experiment at CERN.
The code was modified in order to study the topology of the di-photon events coming from the decay of the ALP. 
The code was also modified in order to extract for specific mass and coupling points the expected number of events in order to convolute these results with the efficiencies of the simulated Pre Shower in GEANT4.
